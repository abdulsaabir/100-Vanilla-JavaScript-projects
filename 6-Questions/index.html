                The desire to be seen/valued was the biggest perceived appeal of fame, followed by the desire for status, followed by a prosocial motivation. Interestingly, the motivations were associated with different fundamental human needs.

                I Love Software Engineering
                
                Software engineer, to me, is an art, a creativity and intelligent skills to breath life into the code and build applications to solve the day to day affairs. It is a passion to work with 0s and 1s and give them a meaning which can be understood by the machines as well as humans.
