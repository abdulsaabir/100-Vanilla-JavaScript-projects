In this Project, you will learn how to create a modal window which is used on websites to get users to do or see something specific.

A good example of a modal window would be if a user made changes in a site without saving them and tried to go to another page. You can create a modal window that warns them to save their changes or else that information will be lost.

Key concepts covered:

* document.querySelector()<br>
* addEventListener()<br>
* classList.add()<br>
* classList.remove()<br>
