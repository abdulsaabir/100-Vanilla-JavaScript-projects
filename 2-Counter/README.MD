In this Project you will learn how to create a counter and write conditions that change the color based on positive or negative numbers displayed.

This project will give you more practice working with the DOM and you can use this simple counter in other projects like a pomodoro clock.

## Key concepts covered:

* document.querySelectorAll()<br>
* forEach()<br>
* addEventListener()<br>
* currentTarget property<br>
* classList<br>
* textContent<br>
